Likay
=====

Likay is a responsive web and mobile SMS app
for disaster prevention and mitigation. It will utilize data from
wunderground.com, and use SMS via Youphoric API for location-based
alerts and notifications. As a crowdsourced app, registered users
can also send their SMS 'tweets' which will then be posted real-time
on the web front-end.

It is built using Django framework and utilizes the YouPhoric API for
sending outbound messages and handle incoming ones.

This is a team effort project which serves as a submission for the
2013 AngelHack Davao event.
